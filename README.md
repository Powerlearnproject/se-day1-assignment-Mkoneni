#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

It is a branch of computer science that is used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
It is reliable, efficient, scalable and flexible, and secure.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Mastering complexity: involves managing and simplifying the intricate relationship between different components, systems and stakeholders in software development.
Mastering process: involves the ability to plan, execute and control the software development lifecycle.
Mastering machine: involves the understanding and utilization of the underlying technology, tools, and infrastructure in software development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning: identify the software requirement or purpose and scope
Requirement analysis: identify the final user specification
Design: build theframework
Coding: convert the software design into tangible code
testing: test the software for any bugs and glitches


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential model, where each phase is  completed before moving on. 
It has low flexibility, changes are hard to incorportate once a phase is complete, customer feedback comes late, once the product is developed and testing is done at the end of the development phase 
The waterfall model is approp\riate for developing a a simple e-commerce website. 
The Agile model is an iterative and incremental model with mith multiple cycles.
it is highly flexible, and dapts to changing requirements. Customer feedback is incorporated into every split and testing  is continous and is done after every iteration.
The Agile model is suitable for implementing a large-scale digitaltransformation project with multiple stakeholders and changing requirements



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer: developing applications, programs and systems using programming language and frameworks.
                    maintaining and updating the software to keep it functional.
                    collaborating with other team members to enure best practises when developing software.
                    reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
                    
Quality Assurance engineer: collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software development.
                            create development standards and procedures for programmers to follow.
                            confirm that software meets the requirement before deployment.
                            analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make it more efficient.
                            develop and execute automation scipts using open source tools.

Project manager: assembles and leads the software development team.
                 discusses the project and its requirements with the client and with the software development team.
                 creates blueprint for the project.
                 tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
                 deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its perfomarnace.
                 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Intergrated development environment (IDE) is a software development platform that facilitates the creation of software applications by providing a space to write, compile and debug code, sometimes with
value-adding development tools that reduce development efforts, e.g. Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

Importance: Programming languages have many rules for how statements must be written, because IDE knows these rule, it has got many intelligent features that automatically write and edit the source code.
            IDE can format written code by automatically making some words bold, italic or by changing the font coulour. The visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
            IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
            IDE increases programmer productivity by perfroming repeatable programming tasks that are typically part of every code change, e.g:
                It compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating software understands. Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling 
                in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine-code from within the application.
            IDE allows developers to automate unit-tests locally before their software is intergrated twith other developers' code and more complex integrtion tests are run.
            Debugging IDE enables a step in the code, line by line, as the code is running and inspects code behaviour. IDEs also intergrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error
            in real-time, even as the developer is busy typing.

Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools that allows teams to manage changes made to the soure code over time, e.g. Git.

Importance: Collaboration - enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicting.
            Change tracking - records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of every modification.
            Branching and merging - allows creation of branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
            Error recovery - allows reverting back to older versions if new changes cause errors.
            

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Rapid technological advancement: places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry.
Time Constraints: software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints
Limited Infrastructure: limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
Changing Software Requirements: Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and
develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design,
which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
Software Security: Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
Software Accessibility and Usability: Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit tests: are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software.
it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
Integration tests: verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
helps to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
System testing: Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
it helps to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security.
Acceptance tests: are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
it tests whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

prompt engineering: is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance: Improved user experience: Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.
            Increased flexibility: A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
            developer control: Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models.           


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Draw a picture of a person.
Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.

Why: Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.
     Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
     Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
